                        </h3>
                        <p>VRDog collects personally identifiable information ("PII") such as your name, email
                            address, postal address, and billing and credit card information when you shop with us
                            online; register with our Site; save your information with us online; use a VRDog
                            social networking or mobile application; or participate in a sweepstakes contest, promotion
                            or survey. When you submit a question to customer service, we will need your email address
                            to respond, and you may also provide us with additional information to help us answer your
                            question. If you create an account through our site using an SNS Account, we may also
                            collect your date of birth, ZIP code, and other information that is not considered PII
                            because it can’t be used by itself to identify you. We don’t receive or store passwords for
                            any of your SNS Accounts.</p>
                        <p>Whenever you browse vrdog.com, we automatically receive and record information such as
                            your IP address, browser type, domain name and specific vrdog.com web pages through
                            which you click.&nbsp; We may maintain a record of your product interests and the purchases
                            you make on-line.&nbsp; We may secure information about you from unrelated third
                            parties.&nbsp; We may also collect demographic information, and we may use mailing lists
                            from third parties. We may combine information about you that we have with information we
                            obtain from business partners or other companies.</p>

                            networking and mobile applications, we may need to capture and record certain location-data
                            regarding your use of the application and your travels in order to provide location-related
                            functionality ("Location-Data"). We may link that Location-Data to other information that
                            you provide to us or that may be accessed in connection with your use of the application.
                            &nbsp;Your use of, and our ability to offer functionality through, the application is then
                            enabled through our use of Location-Data and associated information.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>VRDog uses computer "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) to make your
                            shopping experience more efficient, convenient and personalized. Cookies are alphanumeric
                            identifiers that enable our systems to recognize your browser. Through the use of these
                            cookies, VRDog may automatically collect non-personal information and data, such as
                            your IP address, Internet service provider, location, language, your computer software types
                            and versions, screen resolution and colors, domain name, how you got to our Site (including

                        <p>Cookies are not required for you to browse our Site; however, if you don’t accept Cookies,
                            you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Cookies do not
                            contain any PII. They are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. The
                            Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
                            accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or
                            how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some
                            of our Site's features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>
                        <p>A web beacon (also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF) is a graphic image which is used to
                            better understand the browsing patterns of visitors to the page. Web beacons may be included
                            in our web pages and e-mail messages. We may use cookies and web beacons for insight with
                            respect to the usage of the Site, tracking and monitoring advertising effectiveness, so that
                            we could continually improve our customer’s experience. At times, we use third-parties to
                            analyze usage of our website. However, we do not disclose your personally identifiable
                            information to such third-parties.</p>

                            assist us in responding to your inquiries or requests or otherwise serve you, or for the
                            purpose(s) authorized when it was submitted.&nbsp;For example, we may retain an outside
                            company to create and distribute a direct mail or email offering. Other examples include
                            fulfilling meal plan orders, delivering meals, sending postal mail and e-mail, text
                            messages, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links

                            service.&nbsp; In those situations, the outside company is performing work for VRDog,
                            and VRDog takes appropriate steps designed to ensure your privacy and that your PII is
                            used only to provide the services requested by us, and not for other purposes.&nbsp; These
                            third parties are required to treat this information in a manner that is consistent with
                            this Privacy Policy.</p>
                        <p>VRDog may also disclose said PII to third-parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send
                            your information, or under limited circumstances specifically described to you when we
                            collect the information, as in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions.</p>
                        <p>We reserve the right to release account and other PII about you when we believe release is
                            appropriate to ensure compliance with the law and the safety and security of our Site,
                            including in response to legal process and law enforcement requests; to enforce or apply our
                            Terms of Service and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, safety or other
                            interests of VRDog, affiliates and shareholders, or others. This includes exchanging
                            information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
                            reduction.</p>
