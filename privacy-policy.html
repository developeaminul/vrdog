                          <p>VRDog collects personally identifiable information ("PII") such as your name, email
                              address, postal address, and billing and credit card information when you shop with us
                              online; register with our Site; save your information with us online; use a VRDog
                              social networking or mobile application; or participate in a sweepstakes contest, promotion
                              or survey. When you submit a question to customer service, we will need your email address
                              to respond, and you may also provide us with additional information to help us answer your
                              question. If you create an account through our site using an SNS Account, we may also
                              collect your date of birth, ZIP code, and other information that is not considered PII
                              because it can’t be used by itself to identify you. We don’t receive or store passwords for
                              any of your SNS Accounts.</p>
                          <p>Whenever you browse vrdog.com, we automatically receive and record information such as

                              which you click.&nbsp; We may maintain a record of your product interests and the purchases
                              you make on-line.&nbsp; We may secure information about you from unrelated third
                              parties.&nbsp; We may also collect demographic information, and we may use mailing lists
                              from third parties. We may combine information about you that we have with information we

                              regarding your use of the application and your travels in order to provide location-related
                              functionality ("Location-Data"). We may link that Location-Data to other information that
                              you provide to us or that may be accessed in connection with your use of the application.
                              &nbsp;Your use of, and our ability to offer functionality through, the application is then
                              enabled through our use of Location-Data and associated information.</p>

                          </h3>
                          <p>VRDog uses computer "cookies" (small files placed on your hard drive) to make your
                              shopping experience more efficient, convenient and personalized. Cookies are alphanumeric
                              identifiers that enable our systems to recognize your browser. Through the use of these
                              cookies, VRDog may automatically collect non-personal information and data, such as
                              your IP address, Internet service provider, location, language, your computer software types
                              and versions, screen resolution and colors, domain name, how you got to our Site (including

                              you visit the Site, and specific VRDog web pages through which you click and how long
                              you spend on each page.</p>
                          <p>Cookies are not required for you to browse our Site; however, if you don’t accept Cookies,
                              you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Cookies do not
                              contain any PII. They are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. The
                              Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from
                              accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or
                              how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some
                              of our Site's features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.</p>
                          <p>A web beacon (also known as a pixel tag or clear GIF) is a graphic image which is used to
                              better understand the browsing patterns of visitors to the page. Web beacons may be included
                              in our web pages and e-mail messages. We may use cookies and web beacons for insight with
                              respect to the usage of the Site, tracking and monitoring advertising effectiveness, so that
                              we could continually improve our customer’s experience. At times, we use third-parties to
                              analyze usage of our website. However, we do not disclose your personally identifiable
                              information to such third-parties.</p>

                              purpose(s) authorized when it was submitted.&nbsp;For example, we may retain an outside
                              company to create and distribute a direct mail or email offering. Other examples include
                              fulfilling meal plan orders, delivering meals, sending postal mail and e-mail, text
                              messages, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links
                              (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer
                              service.&nbsp; In those situations, the outside company is performing work for VRDog,
                              and VRDog takes appropriate steps designed to ensure your privacy and that your PII is

                          <p>VRDog may also disclose said PII to third-parties to whom you explicitly ask us to send
                              your information, or under limited circumstances specifically described to you when we
                              collect the information, as in the rules of sweepstakes or other promotions.</p>
                          <p>We reserve the right to release account and other PII about you when we believe release is
                              appropriate to ensure compliance with the law and the safety and security of our Site,
                              including in response to legal process and law enforcement requests; to enforce or apply our
                              Terms of Service and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, safety or other
                              interests of VRDog, affiliates and shareholders, or others. This includes exchanging
                              information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk
                              reduction.</p>
